# DAW1617-Ionic
===============

This is the final project presented by David Corral for the Ionic task in the subject DAW 2016/17.

This app has been tested on Android and Web. In order to make it run, first you have to set your own API Keys:
* In [/src/providers/weather.ts]() line 9 you have to set your OpenWeather API Key.
* In [/src/index.html]() line 18 you have to set your Google Maps API Key.
* In [/www/index.html]() line 18 you have to set your Google Maps API Key.

Then, you will be able to run it:
1. `ionic serve` to run the app in your browser.
2. `ionic run android` to run the app in your Android device.
